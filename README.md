pMarshal is a DeFi wallet platform where you can organize and monitor all your defi wallets in one place. Easily track transactions and balances, set alerts on activities, and more all in real-time. This provides an easy way for newbies and tech/non-tech savvy individuals to have a collective view of their finances like with traditional banks. A twist this platform also provides is analytics, users can create a portfolio of any wallet even if not their own and track activity. Great for following fraudulent wallets that have scammed users or hacked communities (e.g DAO's, networks).
